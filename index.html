        <p>Education is never neutral: it either maintains the <a href=https://mappingpoliceviolence.org>system of domination</a>, or it is designed to <a href="http://revolt.axismaps.com">liberate people</a>; I believe that <a href=https://scalar.usc.edu/works/race-and-the-digital/from-tweets-to-streets-a-research-project?path=index>rethinking design education</a>so that it is underpinned by these principles will be crucial to the larger project of <a href=https://scalar.usc.edu/works/race-and-the-digital/index>design justice</a>.
